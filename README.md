# blescan-backend
This backend is used in combination with the [blescan](https://github.com/Crowd-Management-Japan/blescan/) application.
It is a flask application that creates an API that blescan can send its data to.

It also offers a more convenient way to set up multiple Raspberry Pi's with blescan.
The blescan-wrapper will automatically check for updates on the server and then proceed to download the newest configuration.
